                        <p>
                          Here we go again! Welcome to module 8! Usually, we're trying to get rid of obstacles in life,
                          but today we're going to make some.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Last we left the block dodger game, we had a player block which we were able to ease left
                          and right using our mouse (pretty cool, eh?) and we used conditionals to prevent it from
                          moving off the edge of the screen (even cooler?). But we don't have any blocks to dodge!
                          Let's add some!
                        </p>
                        <img alt="Moon landing meme" style="margin: 15px;" 
                          src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/34/0d/70/340d70a2463403c8cb9849693ce70635.jpg">
                        <p>
                          There is a saying that counting goes "one, two, three, infinity." In other words, once you
                          can handle making the conceptual leap between one to two, and two to three, going further is a trivial
                          repetition of that process. In our case, making our first 
                          object or two is pretty tough, but once we have a constructor function (see the 
                          <a href="module7.html">previous module</a> if you're not sure what that means) and two concepts we'll 
                          learn about today, <i>arrays</i> and <i>loops</i>, we can make and manage as many objects as our heart 
                          desires (or until we run the computer out of memory).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And, by the way, the objects we'll be making aren't going to be more player boxes (we only need
                          one of those); they'll be obstacle boxes which will fall from the top of the screen. Did you 
                          guess that we'll need another constructor function to do that? Good!
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 id="obstacle">Make an obstacle!</h2>
                        <p>
                          Let's start by deciding what properties and functions our new <code class="js">Obstacle</code> class
                          will need. Then we'll get a single obstacle on screen. Once that's working, we'll add a few 
                          obstacles and call it a day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Actually, it turns out the <code class="js">Obstacle</code> class is going to be very similar 
                          to the player <code class="js">Box</code> class. It'll have the standard <code class="js">x</code>, 
                          <code class="js">y</code>, 
                          <code class="js">size</code>, and <code class="js">color</code>, plus one new property: a 
                          <code class="js">vy</code> property, which represents the obstacle's velocity, or rate of change, 
                          on the y-axis. Obstacles will also need a <code class="js">move()</code> 
                          function, just like the player box, but the obstacle's movement behavior will be different (and 
                          a bit simpler). Here's all of that in code:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// This class represents an obstacle the player must avoid
let Obstacle = function (x, y, vy, size, color) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
  this.vy = vy;
  this.size = size;
  this.color = color;
};

// Updates an obstacle's position
Obstacle.prototype.move = function () {
  this.y += this.vy;
};</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Look familiar? It's not all that different from the player box class! Now
                          we can use our new <code class="js">Obstacle</code> constructor to actually make an obstacle and draw it.
                          But before moving further, I notice that my code has multiple lines of code that are part of 
                          a single task that I'm going to want to be reusable (did someone say "function"?):
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Make a new player box
player = new Box(canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 20, 20, "#ffffff");

// Set the mouse's initial value
mouseX = 0;
  
// Listen for mouse movements
document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
  mouseX = e.pageX - canvas.getBoundingClientRect().left;
});</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          So let's toss all of this, plus the line to create a new <code class="js">Obstacle</code> inside of an
                          <code class="js">init()</code> (short for initialize) function and call it. Note that
                          the call to the obstacle's constructor has an additional parameter for the <code class="js">vy</code>,
                          which I made 2 (try other numbers here to change the speed of the obstacle):
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">function init() {
  
  // Make a new player box
  player = new Box(canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 20, 20, "#ffffff");
  
  // Make an obstacle
  obstacle = new Obstacle(canvas.width / 2, 0, 2, 30, "#ccccff");
  
  // Set the mouse's initial value 
  mouseX = canvas.width / 2;
  
  // Listen for mouse movements
  document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
    mouseX = e.pageX - canvas.getBoundingClientRect().left;
  });
}

// Initialize the game
init();</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          This function sets up the game state by giving default values to all of our variables. To use it, we need
                          to create the <code class="js">obstacle</code> variable and add movement and draw code to the 
                          <code class="js">update()</code> function. With all that in place, here's our current state of affairs:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Did you catch that? An obstacle falls from the center of the screen and disappears (run it again if you missed it!).
                          Try tweaking the parameters in the <code class="js">new Obstacle()</code> call to the <code class="js">Obstacle</code>'s
                          constructor and see what happens.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="one-to-many">From one to many</h2>
                        <p>
                          Now we have an obstacle! We can't collide with it yet--we'll add that feature in the next module. 
                          Although our goal is to get a ton of obstacles, we broke the problem
                          down into a smaller one: getting one obstacle on the screen, which we already knew how to do. This is
                          a common strategy in programming: breaking large problems down into small ones, then proceeding towards
                          the end result incrementally.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          Onward, to arrays! Arrays are, like objects, a way to group related pieces of data in 
                          your program's memory. However, where objects' properties and functions are accessed by unique names, 
                          for example, <code class="js">box.x</code>, array elements are accessed by an index number, for example, 
                          <code class="js">students[4]</code>. This means that data in arrays is ordered numerically, while objects' data isn't. 
                          The practical implication of all this is that arrays are best suited for grouping one type of data,
                          which can easily be identified by number, whereas objects are groups of many different
                          types of data which need to be identified by name. For our block dodger game, we want to create a 
                          collection of <code class="js">Obstacle</code> objects.
                          The naive way to accomplish this is to use a bunch of variables, say, <code class="js">obstacle1</code>, 
                          <code class="js">obstacle2</code>, <code class="js">obstacle3</code> and so on, but this is clearly going to
                          become impossible to manage very quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Let's adjust our code to use an array instead of a single <code class="js">obstacle</code> variable 
                          to see how this plays out. Start by pluralizing the <code class="js">obstacle</code> variable--it'll 
                          store our array of obstacles. Next, in the <code class="js">init()</code> function, we'll set the 
                          <code class="js">obstacles</code> variable to an empty array (denoted by the empty 
                          <code class="js">[]</code> brackets):
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Initializes the game
function init() {
  
  // Make a new player box
  player = new Box(canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 20, 20, "#ffffff");
  
  // Make obstacles an empty array
  obstacles = [];
  
  // Set the mouse's initial value 
  mouseX = canvas.width / 2;
  
  // Listen for mouse movements
  document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
    mouseX = e.pageX - canvas.getBoundingClientRect().left;
  });
}
</code></pre>
                       <p>
                         However, changing our variable from <code class="js">obstacle</code> to <code class="js">obstacles</code>
                         invalidates our current <code class="js">update()</code> function, and we've removed the code
                         that creates a new obstacle. We need to populate our empty array with 
                         obstacle objects and then adjust our <code class="js">update()</code> code to process (move, draw) 
                         each object in the array.
                       </p>
                       <hr>
                       <h2 id="adding-to-arrays">Adding items to arrays</h2>
                       <p>
                         Arrays have a ton of useful functions to add and remove
                         items in various ways. To add an item to the end of an array, call the array's <code class="js">push()</code>
                         function and pass the item as its parameter. Here's an example of <code class="js">push()</code> using 
                         an array of strings, instead of objects, for simplicity's sake:
                       </p>  
<pre><code class="js">// Declare a new empty array
let people = [];

// Add "Geraldine" to the array
people.push("Geraldine");
console.log(people);  // [ 'Geraldine' ]

// Add "Alex" to the array
people.push("Alex");
console.log(people);  // [ 'Geraldine', 'Alex' ]
console.log(people[1]);  // 'Alex'</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Let's do the same in our <code class="js">init()</code> function, 
                          except we'll add a few new <code class="js">Obstacle</code> objects to the array instead of strings:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Initializes the game
function init() {
  
  // Make a new player box
  player = new Box(canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 20, 20, "#ffffff");
  
  // Make obstacles an empty array
  obstacles = [];
  
  // Add a few obstacles to the array
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(10, 0, 1, 30, "#5959ee"));
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(100, 0, 1, 20, "#9999ff"));
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(200, 0, 2, 25, "#8877ef"));
  console.log(obstacles); 
  
  // Set the mouse's initial value 
  mouseX = canvas.width / 2;
  
  // Listen for mouse movements
  document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (e) {
    mouseX = e.pageX - canvas.getBoundingClientRect().left;
  });
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Let's open the browser console and view the result of the <code class="js">console.log()</code> call:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This gives us a lot of handy information about the array! At the top, <code class="js">Array(3)</code> 
                          tells us we have an array 
                          with three items in it. Right below, at index 0, is an <code class="js">Obstacle</code> object with a 
                          variety of properties. Note that expanding the <code class="js">__proto__</code> on the object at index 2 shows us the 
                          functions associated with these objects: <code class="js">move</code> and <code class="js">constructor</code>
                          and their parameters. Bottom line: we've successfully made an array and added some objects to it!
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="loops">Loops, loops, loops</h2>
                        <p>
                          All right! Now, we have an array with items in it, but our <code class="js">update()</code> code is still 
                          trying to find an <code class="js">obstacle</code>, which no longer exists, to move and draw it.
                          That won't work--we have three obstacles, and they're all in an array, so we need some way
                          to access each one specifically in order to move and draw it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We can solve this problem the naive way with the following code:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Update and draw each obstacle by index
obstacles[0].move();
ctx.fillStyle = obstacles[0].color;
ctx.fillRect(obstacles[0].x, obstacles[0].y, 
             obstacles[0].size, obstacles[0].size);
obstacles[1].move();
ctx.fillStyle = obstacles[1].color;
ctx.fillRect(obstacles[1].x, obstacles[1].y, 
             obstacles[1].size, obstacles[1].size);
obstacles[2].move();
ctx.fillStyle = obstacles[2].color;
ctx.fillRect(obstacles[2].x, obstacles[2].y, 
             obstacles[2].size, obstacles[2].size);</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          This works, but yuck! And what if our array has a few dozen, or even a million items in it (a common computer science
                          scenario!)? We'd have to type some three million lines of code--clearly, we need a new trick! 
                          Whenever you need to perform some action on each item in an
                          array, or many other actions requiring repetition, use a <i>for loop</i>. For loops can be a little
                          tricky syntactically at first, so type carefully and compare the below code to the above code (both
                          accomplish the same task of moving and drawing each obstacle):
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Update and draw each obstacle with a for loop
for (let i = 0; i &lt; obstacles.length; i++) {
  obstacles[i].move();
  ctx.fillStyle = obstacles[i].color;
  ctx.fillRect(obstacles[i].x, obstacles[i].y, 
               obstacles[i].size, obstacles[i].size);
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          This code is scalable. We don't need to worry about how many items are in the <code class="js">obstacles</code>
                          array: the loop initializes an index variable, <code class="js">i</code>, to 0 and runs as long as
                          <code class="js">i</code> is less than the length (or number of items) of the <code class="js">obstacles</code> array.
                          On the first run through the block of code between the <code class="js">{ }</code>, <code class="js">i</code> is
                          0, and the first element in the array is moved and drawn. Then, the <code class="js">i++</code> increment
                          is run and <code class="js">i</code> is equal to 1. Then, the block of code between the <code class="js">{ }</code> 
                          runs a second time and the second block is drawn. Then <code class="js">i++</code> runs again, and so on, until
                          the loop counter reaches the length of the array and the loop stops.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          Here's how to break down for loop syntax; the initialization code runs once at the beginning of the loop.
                          That's usually where variables are declared for counting through the loop.
                          The end conditional test runs before each loop, and if it's false, the loop stops executing, otherwise
                          the body of the loop is executed. The third part of the for loop, labeled "post-body code," runs after each 
                          trip through the loop body, and is typically where loop control variables are incremented.
<pre><code class="js">for (/*initialization code*/; /*end conditional*/; /*post-body code*/) {
  // Loop body, a block of code to execute on each trip through the loop
}</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Let's take another simple example; run this code and play with it to convince yourself of how it works:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Count to 100 with a loop
for (let i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Putting it all together, let's run the code and see what happens.
                        </p>

                          Celebration! There are three obstacles dropping from the top of the screen. The best news is that our array
                          and loop are done, waiting to handle as many items as we care to throw at them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Whew! Great job with some tricky concepts here. As always, try tweaking the code, adding more 
                          <code class="js">obstacle</code> objects, and playing with the numbers. Break it and fix it and keep playing
                          with examples until it becomes clear how it all works--arrays and loops are pretty complicated at first,
                          but they'll become second nature with enough exposure!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <a href="module9.html">Next module</a> is when the game comes together: we add utility functions to randomize 
                          how blocks are generated and check for collisions between the player and obstacles. We'll also need to add the 
                          ever-important score variable.  We'll also touch up a few odds and ends and optimize the code here and there.
                          After that, you'll have yourself a pretty solid and enjoyable block dodger game to mess around with.
                          The main concepts will be applicable to all programming projects: variables to store data in memory, operators
                          to manipulate the data, objects and arrays to organize and collect data, conditionals to enable the program 
                          to respond dynamically to different situations, functions to modularize and reuse code, and loops to 
                          automate repetitive tasks. 
                        </p>  
                        <p>  
                          Don't worry about memorizing the syntax; just try to remember what kind of
                          programming concept you need for a particular scenario, then look the syntax up as necessary. I've created a 
                          handy <a href="cheatsheet.html">JS cheat sheet</a> for just that purpose!
