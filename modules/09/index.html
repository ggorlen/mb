                          Woohoo! Here we are at module 9, the penultimate module of the course, and the
                          one where we wrap up the block dodger game! Believe it or not, but we've covered 
                          all of the major points of basic programming, so this last module is less about
                          introducing new concepts and more about practicing what we've already learned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          As you've noticed, we still have a few missing pieces standing in the way
                          between where we are now and a full-blown block dodger, including generation
                          of obstacle blocks, collision detection between obstacles and the player box,
                          and a player score. We'll handle these features by making use of
                          JS's built-in Math library, a new array function, and adding a few additional 
                          functions to keep our code organized.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="randomize-it">Randomize it!</h2>
                        <p>
                          Random numbers are very important in game design (and programming in general!). They're an
                          easy way to reduce predictability, simulate chance, and add a natural feel to applications. 
                          Most programming languages have a variety of handy ways to get random numbers, but JS
                          offers fairly slim pickings: <code class="js">Math.random()</code>, which returns a random
                          decimal between 0 and 1. Let's put this to use in generating our falling obstacles:
                          instead of hard-coding three obstacles to appear in the <code class="js">init()</code> function as we did...
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Add a few obstacles to the array
obstacles.push(new Obstacle(10, 0, 1, 30, "#5959ee"));
obstacles.push(new Obstacle(100, 0, 1, 20, "#9999ff"));
obstacles.push(new Obstacle(200, 0, 2, 25, "#8877ef"));
</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          ...we'll remove those lines and head over to the <code class="js">update()</code> function, where
                          we'll use a conditional and <code class="js">Math.random()</code> to determine whether,
                          at a given frame, a new <code class="js">obstacle</code> gets created or not:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Generate a new obstacle every so often
if (Math.random() &gt; 0.98) {
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(canvas.width / 2, -20, 2, 20, "#8877ef"));
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          If my math is correct, this works out to about a 1 percent chance that on any given frame, 
                          an obstacle will be created. Try adjusting the <code class="js">0.98</code> number and see 
                          how the frequency of obstacle generation changes--it's pretty sensitive, so consider
                          adding decimal places for better precision.

                        <h2 id="more-random-numbers">More random numbers</h2>
                        <p>
                          Now that we're using random numbers, let's take a moment to add a utility function
                          to our program to produce random integers between two bounds. Random integers will be useful
                          for randomizing the placement and properties of our obstacles. Utility functions are 
                          very general and reusable functions that handle simple tasks, saving a lot of trouble.
                          The below function takes a range of input between a low and high number, and returns
                          a random whole number between the two. Technically, the lower bound is inclusive
                          and the upper bound is exclusive, meaning it's possible for the function to return
                          the low number but not the high number.
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Returns a random number between two bounds
function randInt(lo, hi) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (hi - lo) + lo);
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          If you're curious, the way this works is multiplying <code class="js">Math.random()</code> by an integer <i>x</i>
                          produces a random decimal between 0 and <i>x</i>. Subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound
                          before this operation, then re-adding the lower bound to the result puts the number 
                          in the correct range. At this point, the number is still a decimal, so <code class="js">Math.floor()</code> is used
                          to chop off that decimal. Try it out with <code class="js">randInt(5, 15);</code> and test the results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But honestly, the details aren't too important here: it works; use it! Most programming languages
                          offer this function as a standard library feature, so you wouldn't have to worry about the implementation
                          details in those languages--don't sweat them here either!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Let's put this function to use! But before we do, we're about to be making a mess in our nice,
                          clean <code class="js">update()</code> function. It's a good idea to extrapolate this burgeoning 
                          obstacle-making code to a separate function, <code class="js">makeObstacle()</code>, keeping 
                          the dirty details away from <code class="js">update()</code>.
                        </p>  
<pre><code class="js">// Generates some random values for an Obstacle and 
// adds the new Obstacle to the obstacles array
function makeObstacle() {
  let size = randInt(10, 20);
  let x = randInt(0, canvas.width - size);
  let y = 0 - size;
  let color = "hsl(200, " + randInt(0, 100) + "%, 60%)";
  let vy = (Math.random() + 1) * 30 / size;
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(x, y, vy, size, color));
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          The above code looks complex, but all of the numbers and operations were found through old fashioned trial 
                          and error; you'll come up with your own tricks for finding the right "feel" for these kinds of things, 
                          which is why I'm endlessly encouraging you to tweak my examples (go ahead, play with the above 
                          code--when it gets too complex, revert to simple literal numbers!).
                          For example, I wanted smaller objects to move faster than larger objects, so I made the velocity inversely 
                          proportional to size. The <code class="js">color</code> variable uses <code class="js">hsl()</code>, which 
                          is just another way to represent color; check the explanation 
                          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp">here</a> to learn more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          All right; now, we'll call <code class="js">makeObstacle()</code> from the <code class="js">update()</code> 
                          function, and we've got ourselves a pretty nifty looking near-game:

                        <h2 id="collision-detection">Collision detection</h2>
                        <p>
                          Next, we really need collision detection, or some function that tells us if two boxes are overlapping.
                          Collision detection can be a very complex topic, but luckily,
                          it's pretty straightforward as it relates to rectangles. The idea is to check whether each rectangle's
                          x coordinate is between the other rectangle's bounds on the x axis and repeat the process for the 
                          y axis. If it passes tests on both axes, they're intersecting somewhere. Here's the code:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Returns true if a and b rectangles 
// are colliding, false otherwise
function collides(a, b) {
  return a.x &lt;= b.x + b.size &&
         b.x &lt;= a.x + a.size &&
         a.y &lt;= b.y + b.size &&
         b.y &lt;= a.y + b.size;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Looking at this for too long can make your head hurt, and it's written here a little less for readability 
                          and more for succinctness; this sort of stuff is best handled by a game framework
                          with pre-written complex collision detection algorithms, by searching a programming
                          help or reference websites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or avoidng games
                          that have heavy amounts of collision detection and physics, such as platformers and shooters 
                          (at least for your first project). That is,
                          assuming you're not a math buff (power to you if you are!). In the meantime, just plug in the one
                          above and enjoy!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And, of course, we need to actually make a call to the <code class="js">collides()</code> function
                          and send it two boxes. But where? This is a great job for the loop we're using to move and render our 
                          obstacles--since we're already doing that, we'll just add a collision check inside the loop 
                          and re-initialize the game if a collision occurs: 
                        </p>
                            
<pre><code class="js">// Check for a collision between the player and this obstacle.
// Reinitialize the game if there was a collision.
if (collides(player, obstacles[i])) {
  init();
  break;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          The <code class="js">break;</code> statement simply ends the for loop immediately; once a new game
                          has been set up in the <code class="js">init()</code> function, there will no longer be any obstacles 
                          in the newly-cleared <code class="js">obstacles</code>
                          array, and the game will crash (we'll talk more about bugs in the next module). Let's take a look
                          at the whole <code class="js">update()</code> function since it's quite large (it's also visible in the 
                          Codepen below). In all honesty, it might be high time to split this function into smaller helper
                          functions, but we'll call it sufficient for now.
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Updates the animation state and draws a frame
function update() {
    
  // Generate a new obstacle every so often
  if (Math.random() &gt; 0.95) {
    makeObstacle();
  }
  
  // Clear the entire canvas
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  
  // Update the position of the player
  player.move(mouseX);
  
  // Draw the player box

  ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, player.size, player.size);
  
  // Update and draw the obstacles
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; obstacles.length; i++) {
    
    // Update this obstacle's position
    obstacles[i].move();
    
    // Check for a collision between the player and this obstacle.
    // Reinitialize the game if there was a collision.
    if (collides(player, obstacles[i])) {
      init();
      break;
    }
    
    // Draw the obstacle

                          There are only two remaining things we should take care of before calling this game done.
                          One is a classic arcade game feature whose importance cannot be overstated: score! It's a simple
                          addition, but putting a number on the player's performance adds a competitive feel and an addictive 
                          quality that makes it more than worth the small amount of trouble. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The second feature to think about is a very subtle optimization issue. What happens to obstacles that
                          fly below the bottom of the screen? To find out if they're still there, we can add a <code class="js">console.log()</code>
                          statement and print the length of our <code class="js">obstacles</code> array every time we make a new one:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Generates some random values for an Obstacle and 
// adds the new Obstacle to the obstacles array
function makeObstacle() {
  let size = randInt(10, 20);
  let x = randInt(0, canvas.width - size);
  let y = 0 - size;
  let color = "hsl(200, " + randInt(0, 100) + "%, 60%)";
  let vy = (Math.random() + 1) * 30 / size;
  obstacles.push(new Obstacle(x, y, vy, size, color));

  console.log(obstacles.length);
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          If you're skilled enough at the game, you'll notice that the longer the player stays alive, the larger the
                          <code class="js">obstacles</code> array grows. If the player is really good, there could be hundreds or
                          thousands of items in this array, every one of which is being moved, rendered (offscreen, mostly), and
                          checked for collisions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          All of this extra work can slow your game down and bring the player's fun to a 
                          grinding halt. Luckily, the issue isn't too problematic in this simple game--the player will almost
                          always lose before it becomes a problem and modern computers can handle these calculations
                          well. Nonetheless, it illustrates a typical efficiency problem programmers face constantly, 
                          so let's go ahead and resolve it by removing obstacles from the array as soon as they pass the 
                          bottom of the screen. Coincidentally, this is also where I'd like to increase the player's score,
                          which can be thought of as the number of obstacles the player has successfully dodged (you could also make the score
                          time-based, for example).
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          JS offers many functions to remove an item from an array, <code class="js">pop()</code> being the most 
                          common (it removes and returns the last item in the array). However, this won't help in our case,
                          since the obstacle that just flew off screen could be anywhere in the array, so we'll have to resort
                          to a somewhat more technical function, <code class="js">splice()</code>, which takes two number parameters,
                          an index to begin removal at and the number of elements to remove starting from that index. 
                          <code class="js">splice()</code> also allows for adding items to the array in the same call, but we'll ignore
                          those optional features. As always, have a look
                          at a reference site, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp">this one</a>,
                          to learn about what these methods are and how they work--memorization isn't necessary!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Another subtle thing to note is that inside of a loop, if we splice out an item, the loop counter variable 
                          <code class="js">i</code> will be off by one and miss updating the next item in the loop. We could
                          adjust this manually, but my preferred approach is to simply run the for loop backwards; we'll initialize
                          the <code class="js">i</code> index variable to the length of the array - 1, which points to the last
                          item in the array, and count backwards to 0. This way, if any element in the array that 
                          <code class="js">i</code> points to is removed, no problem; <code class="js">i</code> will still
                          point to the correct item on the next iteration:
                        </p>  
<pre><code class="js">for (let i = obstacles.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) { 
  // etc etc ...
}</code></pre>                        
                        <p>
                          And another handy point: we've got a lot of code in our for loop that refers to <code class="js">obstacles[i]</code>,
                          so let's beautify our code by saving this current array element in a variable called <code class="js">o</code> (short for 
                          obstacle) at the beginning of each iteration of the loop:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Update and draw the obstacles
for (let i = obstacles.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
  
  // Save the obstacle in a variable
  let o = obstacles[i];

  // etc etc ...
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Now, anywhere in our code that refers to <code class="js">obstacles[i]</code> in this loop can be replaced 
                          with simply <code class="js">o</code>. Let's put it together; here's the full loop body as it stands,
                          complete with code to remove any off-screen obstacles:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="js">// Update and draw the obstacles
for (let i = obstacles.length - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
  
  // Save the obstacle in a variable
  let o = obstacles[i];
  
  // Update this obstacle's position
  o.move();
  
  // Draw the obstacle
  ctx.fillStyle = o.color;
  ctx.fillRect(o.x, o.y, o.size, o.size);
  
  // Remove this obstacle from the obstacles array if off screen 
  if (o.y - o.size &gt; canvas.height) {
    obstacles.splice(i, 1);
  }
  
  // Check for a collision between the player and this obstacle.
  // Reinitialize the game if there was a collision.
  else if (collides(player, o)) {
    init();
    break;
  }
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Again, this loop code is getting a little large for my taste, but I'll leave refactoring it into its own
                          function, maybe <code class="js">updateObstacle()</code>, perhaps, for the reader.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="score">Last (but not least), adding score</h2>
                        <p>
                          We're almost there! To add a score, we need a--you guessed it!--number variable. We'll initialize it to 0,
                          and whenever an obstacle reaches the bottom of the screen, increment that number by 1. We also need to display
                          the score; this can be done on canvas, but my preference is to output it as HTML inside a 
                          <code class="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element, which avoids obstructing gameplay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To do this, we'll need a new HTML element and some CSS to style it. Here's all of the HTML for the game
                          (with the new <code class="html">&lt;div&gt;</code> element added with an <code class="html">id</code> of 
                          <code class="html">"score-container"</code>):
                        <p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;canvas id="paper" height=500 width=300&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
  &lt;div id="score-container"&gt;score: 0&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          Here's all of the CSS for the game as well:
                        </p>
<pre><code class="css">body {
  display: flex;
  background-color: #000;
  height: 95vh;
  width: 95vw;
}

.container {
  margin: auto;
}

#paper {
  background-color: #000;
  border: 1px solid #fff;
}

#score-container {
  font-family: monospace;
  text-align: center;
  color: #fff;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>
                          With those in place, back in our JS code, we'll need two new variables: a number variable, <code class="js">score</code>,
                          which keeps track of the score, and an object variable, <code class="js">scoreContainer</code>, which will
                          represent the <code class="html">score-container</code> element from the HTML document. This object gives us
                          a function to change its HTML content. Lastly, we'll want to increment the <code class="js">score</code> variable
                          and display it whenever it changes, which occurs in the <code class="js">init()</code> and <code class="js">update()</code>
                          functions. Since this code is scattered throughout the application, I'll show you the final version,
                          then let you find the changed lines and implement them in your version. Try searching for the new variables using
                          your text editor to locate them. As programs grow larger, it can make good sense to split your JS code into
                          multiple files!

                          Congratulations! You made it through quite a challenging tutorial. Please revisit it a few times,
                          even if skimming, to take in the concepts; there is a LOT going on here. Creating your own
                          game or application in the remaining weeks will be the best way to internalize everything
                          you've seen. Another good idea is to find and play with very simple examples of each concept, as we did with loops.

                          While you're welcome to leave this game as-is, I'd also like to suggest a few areas for improvement.
                          I implemented a couple of these features in the final game, so you can start by copying those and
                          adjusting them to your liking.
                          You're welcome to try any of these out or ask for help in adding them to your own game:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Make the frequency (and/or size and/or speed) of new boxes increase as the player survives longer.</li>
                            <li>
                              Clear the canvas using a solid color and 
                              alpha/<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_color_rgba">rgba</a> to 
                              add visual trails to the block's movement.
                            </li>  
                            <li>Add an animation and momentary pause when the player dies.</li>
                            <li>Use images or sprites rather than plain squares.</li>
                            <li>Add particle trails from the falling blocks.</li>
                            <li>
                              Adjust game mechanics such as the option for the player or obstacles to move in 2 dimensions
                              rather than one.
                            </li>  
                            <li>Add power-ups or friendly blocks.</li>
                            <li>Implement a health meter so that being hit once or twice won't be fatal.</li>
                            <li>Make a two-player version.</li>
                          </ul>
