      <h1>git cheat sheet</h1>
      <p>
        Here's the rundown of my basic git workflow. Please note:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This cheat sheet assumes you
          <ol>
            <li> 
              signed up for GitHub and know how to make a repository (<a href="../02/">module 2</a>)
            </li>
            <li>  
              understand terminal basics (<a href="../10/index.html#git">module 10</a>)
            </li>  
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Code in <i>italics</i> is a placeholder and should be replaced with names or paths specific to your project. 
        </li>
        <li>
          git is the command line (terminal) tool, while <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is the website that hosts your git repositories.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't type text following a <code>#</code> in the commands below. These are comments to explain each command.

      <h2 id="cloning">Cloning</h2>
      <p>
        Start by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">creating a repository</a> or
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">forking an existing repo</a> on GitHub.
        Below, <i>repo</i> refers to your forked repository, while <i>original_repo</i> refers
        to the original repository you forked from. If you didn't fork a repository, it refers to the
        original repository you created.
      </p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/<i>username</i>/<i>repo</i>.git # copy the repository
cd <i>repo</i>                                        # change directory to the repository
git remote add upstream <i>original_repo</i>          # set the upstream to the original repository
</code></pre>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        After you've cloned a repository, here's a workflow to use as you code.
      </p>
<pre><code>git pull upstream master    # merge changes from upstream repository into master branch
git push origin master      # push the latest changes to your forked repository
git checkout -b <i>branch</i>      # checkout a branch and begin coding   
git add <i>filename</i>            # when you're ready to commit your changes to a file
git commit -m "<i>description</i>" # create a commit
git push origin <i>branch</i>      # if you didn't checkout to a branch, your branch is master
</code></pre>
      <p>
        At this point, your changes were pushed to origin (your version of the repository), but 
        if you forked the repository from another source, that source (upstream) doesn't have your changes.
        To ask the owner of that repository to merge your changes into the upstream repository, open a 
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull request</a> and wait
        for the repository owner to merge your changes (or ask you to make modifications). If the owner
        adds you as a collaborator, you can push your code directly to the upstream repository or 
        merge your pull request.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="pr">Pull requests</h2>
      <p>
        If you're an owner of a repository, people who fork your repository may submit pull requests, or 
        proposed changes to the files in the repository. If you trust the person submitting the pull request
        (and there are no merge conflicts--more on this below),
        you can simply <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/">merge the changes on GitHub</a> 
        after taking a look at their proposal. However, in many cases, you'll want to 
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/">run and test the code locally</a> 
        before merging.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2 id="merge">Merge conflicts</h2>
      <p>
        It often happens that a pull attempts to modify a file that has since been changed in the same
        location: there are two mutually exclusive versions and a decision has to be made about which will remain. 
        This scenario is called a
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/">merge conflict</a>. 
        Resolving a merge conflict involves choosing between the two versions, modifying the code accordingly, then
        staging changes as normal with <code>git add .</code> and making a commit.
