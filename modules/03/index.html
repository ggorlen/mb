                          Objective: exercise your game design skills and teamwork with a simple HTML game.

                          Today, we'll embark on your first project, a

                          game.

                        <p>
                          If you're not familiar with the book series, 
                          the idea is to make a collection of pages for a player to navigate through. On each page, 
                          the player will choose some kind of action from a list of choices, each choice represented
                          by a link which leads to other pages, revealing a story. Each page is either an ending with 
                          no further choices or a transition page with additional choices for the player to make. Here's an 
                          <a href="http://bob.ippoli.to/mbit-intro-4-game/">example</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Feel free to be as creative as you want! The only requirements are
                          that pages correctly link together and that each member contributes at least three pages.
                          Projects should be finished by the end of the week.

                              Spend no more than 20 to 30 minutes planning your game. Planning is important, 
                              but don't get bogged down to the point where there won't be time left to implement it. 
                              A good plan should...

                                  state the <b>objective</b> of the game. You'll probably want to spend a few minutes 
                                  writing down any and all ideas that come to mind, then spending a few minutes 
                                  more working as a group to pick the best idea.
                                </p>

                                  determine the <b>scope</b> of the game. Keep it simple so you'll have 
                                  time to finish what you set out to do--you can always add more as time permits.
                                </p>

                                  create a provisional <b>layout</b> of the game states, or different pages a player can visit.

                                  <b>delegate</b> tasks. Who's responsible for which parts of the game?

                              Start programming! Build a standard HTML template for your group to use, share it on Github,
                              then start filling in the game states' text and images. Don't get too bogged down in style concerns;
                              CSS will offer you many more options for handling those in the <a href="../04/">next module</a>.

                          Awesome job! <a href="../04/">Next module</a> will introduce 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, which will be 
                          helpful for adding more visual appeal (colors, backgrounds, layout, etc) to your game. See you then.
